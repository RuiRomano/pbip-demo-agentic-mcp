# Tasks 🧑‍💻

- Create a new semantic model that answers the requirement doc `.input/requirements.md` strictly following the guidelines in the provided knowledge base.
- Name of the semantic model should be `Sales_AW`
- All source code and created documents should go to the `src/` folder. Do not work outside of that folder.
- **Don't implement directly**! First create a technical spec document with name `dev-spec.md` so I can review before implementation.
- Thoroughly read and understand the knowledge base documents in the root of `.kb/` folder.
