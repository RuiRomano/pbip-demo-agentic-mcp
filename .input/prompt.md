# Tasks 🧑‍💻

- **Create a new semantic model** named `Sales_AW` that answers the requirement document `requirements.md`. 
- **Strictly follow the development guidelines in the knowledge base documents** present in the root of the `kb/` folder.
- **Don't implement directly**! Create first a technical spec document with name `dev-spec.md` for my review.
- **All source code and created documents should go to the `src/` folder**. Do not work outside of that folder.
