# Tasks 🧑‍💻

- Thoroughly read and understand the knowledge base documents in the root of `.kb/` folder.
- Create a new semantic model that answers the requirement doc `.input/requirements.md` strictly following the guidelines in the provided knowledge base.
- Name of the semantic model should be `Sales_AW`
- Analyze the datasource tables in `AzureSQLSchema.csv` and pick the tables that best answer the requirements. But dont bring any tables or columns that are not strictly necessary, when in doubt ask me.
- Don't implement directly, first create a technical spec document with name `dev-spec.md` so I can review before implementation.
- All source code and created documents should go to the `src/` folder.
