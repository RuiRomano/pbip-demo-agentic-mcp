# Tasks üßë‚Äçüíª

- **Create a new Power BI Project (PBIP)** with a semantic model named `Sales_AW` that answers the requirement document `requirements.md` and a report (based on `templateReport`) adapted to the semantic model.
- **Strictly follow the development guidelines in the knowledge base documents** present in the root of the `.kb/` folder.
- **Don't implement the project directly!** Start with a good technical **development spec** document with name `dev-spec.md` for my review.
- **All source code and created documents should go to the `src/` folder**. Do not work outside of that folder.
